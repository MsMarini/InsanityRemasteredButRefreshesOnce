## 1.2.1
- Adjusted some of the default config values, and added new presets. (It is recommended to use "Slow" or just delete the old config file)
- Updated the README to reflect the new changes in sanity calculation from 1.2.0
- Fixed hallucinations being too frequent by default

- Probably my last update

## 1.2.0
- Audio assets should now load properly!
- A LOT of under the hood changes, affecting how sanity is gained/lost and many other mechanics, while still retaining the core functionality of the old mod.

## 1.1.2
- The last update from BudgetAirpods
